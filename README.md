# Library Citation Project - Massey University Albany 

## Development Versions

### Flask Web Dev Framework
Python based implementation of the Library Citation Project. 

As at 1st August 2017: The Flask application takes in one input (with three arguments namely: title, author, year) and GETs the number of citations using the Scopus API on the Elsevier Developer API documentation. This displays on another page (template) in a table format using the Bootstrap framework.
